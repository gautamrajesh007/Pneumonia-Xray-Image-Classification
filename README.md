# Pneumonia-Xray-Image-Classification

This repository contains a jupyter notebook file and a model that can be used to classify pneumonia x-ray images. The jupyter notebook file contains the code that was used to train the model, and the model can be used to classify new x-ray images.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Then, open the jupyter notebook file in a jupyter notebook environment. The jupyter notebook file will guide you through the steps of training and testing the model.

## Training the Model

The jupyter notebook file contains the code that was used to train the model. The model was trained on a dataset of over 5856 x-ray images. The training process takes several hours to complete.

## Testing the Model

Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new x-ray images. To do this, open the jupyter notebook file and follow the instructions in the "Testing the Model" section.

## Model Performance

The model was able to achieve an accuracy of about 90% on the test set. This means that the model is able to correctly classify pneumonia x-ray images with a high degree of accuracy.

## Future Work

The model can be improved by training it on a larger dataset of x-ray images. The model can also be improved by using a more sophisticated classification algorithm.
